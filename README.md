The RoboCloudBrain project in Intelligent Robotic Research Center of [Zhejiang Lab](https://en.zhejianglab.com/about/overview/) is created to do research in autonomous operation, intelligent decision making, and intuitive human-machine interaction in unstructured environments. The project is composed of engineers and researchers in auditory and visual signal procesing, natural language processing, robot task understanding and planning, ontoloty engineering, knowledge representation and reasoning to coordinate for efficient research in different groups.


## Robot Cloud Brain group
We are working on the Semantic modeling of the robotic data to enable knowledge based robots. Our approach is based on the use of ontological models to link data and to describe datasets. Our method uses Semantic Web technologies such as Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontologies, Resource Description Framework (RDF) data structure or the SPARQL query language.
